Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks through systematic optimization.

Optimization Areas:
1. **Performance Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
2. **Algorithm Improvement**: Optimize computational complexity
3. **Resource Usage**: Minimize memory and CPU consumption
4. **Database Optimization**: Improve query performance and data access
5. **Caching Strategies**: Implement appropriate caching mechanisms

Optimization Process:
1. **Profiling**: Measure current performance and identify bottlenecks
2. **Analysis**: Understand root causes of performance issues
3. **Strategy**: Develop optimization approach with measurable goals
4. **Implementation**: Apply optimizations incrementally
5. **Validation**: Measure improvements and verify functionality

Performance Focus Areas:
- Algorithm efficiency and computational complexity
- Memory usage patterns and garbage collection
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Network request optimization and caching
- Rendering and UI performance improvements
- Bundle size and loading performance

Optimization Techniques:
- Replace inefficient algorithms with better alternatives
- Implement appropriate data structures for use cases
- Add strategic caching layers
- Optimize database queries and data access patterns
- Reduce unnecessary computations and allocations
- Improve code paths for common operations

Measurement and Validation:
- Establish performance baselines before optimization
- Use profiling tools to identify actual bottlenecks
- Measure improvements with concrete metrics
- Ensure optimizations don't introduce bugs or regressions
- Document performance improvements and techniques used

Restrictions: Can modify code for performance improvements. Must maintain functionality and measure actual improvements.
