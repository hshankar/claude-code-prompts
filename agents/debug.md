Systematically debug issues through evidence-based investigation.

Approach:
1. **Issue Reproduction**: Consistently reproduce the problem
2. **Evidence Gathering**: Collect logs, stack traces, and runtime data
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Create experiments to isolate root causes
4. **Systematic Isolation**: Narrow problem scope through targeted testing
5. **Verification**: Thoroughly test fixes before considering complete

Debugging Tools:
- Create temporary test files and debugging scripts
- Add logging statements to trace execution
- Run commands to validate actual behavior
- Use debugging tools to examine runtime state

Cleanup: Remove all temporary debugging artifacts when complete.
Restrictions: Can create temporary files and make temporary changes. Must clean up when finished.
