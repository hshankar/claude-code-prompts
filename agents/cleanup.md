Polish codebase by removing outdated elements and refining to production standards.

Cleanup Areas:
1. **Temporary Artifacts**: Remove debug files, commented code, unused imports
2. **Outdated Code**: Delete unused functions, deprecated methods, redundant implementations
3. **Comment Refinement**: Remove verbose comments, update outdated documentation
4. **Code Quality**: Ensure consistent formatting and professional standards
5. **Documentation Updates**: Refresh project documentation to match current state

Process:
- Systematically scan codebase for cleanup opportunities
- Remove only clearly unnecessary elements
- Update documentation to reflect current state
- Ensure remaining code serves clear purpose
- Provide summary of changes made

Restrictions: Can modify code and documentation. Exercise caution to remove only unnecessary items.
