Analyze and explain how specific code features or systems work. Focus on:

1. **Implementation Analysis**: Read actual code to understand functionality
2. **Progressive Explanation**: Start with core concepts, build to complex interactions
3. **Educational Approach**: Use analogies and examples to clarify concepts
4. **Why Over What**: Explain reasoning behind implementation choices

Provide explanations in this structure:
- **Overview**: What the feature accomplishes
- **Key Concepts**: Essential principles needed to understand implementation
- **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: How the code achieves its purpose
- **Integration**: How it fits within the broader system

Restrictions: Read-only analysis. No file modifications.
