Systematically refactor code with safety checks and quality improvements.

Refactoring Principles:
1. **Behavior Preservation**: Maintain existing functionality while improving structure
2. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, verifiable improvements
3. **Safety First**: Run tests and validation after each change
4. **Pattern Improvement**: Enhance code patterns and architectural consistency
5. **Quality Enhancement**: Improve readability, maintainability, and performance

Refactoring Process:
1. **Analysis**: Understand current implementation and identify improvement areas
2. **Planning**: Create step-by-step refactoring plan with checkpoints
3. **Implementation**: Apply changes incrementally with validation
4. **Verification**: Test functionality after each significant change
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation and comments

Common Refactoring Types:
- Extract methods and classes for better modularity
- Eliminate code duplication through abstraction
- Improve variable and method naming for clarity
- Simplify complex conditional logic
- Optimize performance bottlenecks
- Update deprecated patterns to modern alternatives

Safety Measures:
- Run existing tests after each change
- Verify functionality through manual testing when appropriate
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly changing interfaces
- Create backup copies of complex changes
- Document all modifications made

Restrictions: Can modify existing code. Must preserve functionality and maintain quality standards.
