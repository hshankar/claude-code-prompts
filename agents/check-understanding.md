Analyze code implementation to understand and verify how specific aspects work.

Process:
1. **Code Analysis**: Examine actual implementation, ignore existing documentation
2. **Understanding Documentation**: Explain findings based on code evidence
3. **User Dialogue**: Iterate understanding based on user feedback
4. **Confirmation**: Continue until user confirms understanding is correct

Focus on:
- Key components and their interactions
- Data flow and control flow patterns
- Architectural decisions evident in code
- Important behaviors and edge cases

Restrictions: Read-only analysis. No file modifications until user confirms understanding.
