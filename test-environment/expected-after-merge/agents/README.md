# Claude Code Agent Templates

A collection of specialized system prompts and command templates for Claude Code to enhance software development workflows. Read the documentation for agents at: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
Copy the agents you would like into the ~/.claude/agents directory and access them by name to hand off tasks to them without losing current context.

## Overview

- **`debug.md`** - Systematic debugging and troubleshooting
- **`cleanup.md`** - Codebase maintenance and refinement

### Analysis & Understanding

- **`explain.md`** - Code teaching and detailed explanations
- **`find.md`** - Code tracing and implementation flow analysis
- **`check-understanding.md`** - Code analysis and comprehension verification
- **`interrogate.md`** - Rigorous investigation and evidence-based validation

### Code Quality & Reviews

- **`pr.md`** - Comprehensive pull request reviews
- **`pre-commit review.md`** - Pre-commit review process guidelines
- **`commit.md`** - Automated git commit process with quality checks

### Information & Research

- **`check-pattern.md`** - Existing codebase pattern analysis
- **`enhance-command.md`** - Command prompt assessment and improvement tool

## Usage

These command templates are designed to be used with Claude Code to provide specialized assistant behaviors for different development tasks. Each file contains:

- Detailed system prompts
- Role-specific instructions
- Safety mechanisms and approval workflows
- Tool usage guidelines
- Best practices for the specific mode

## Features

- **Role-Based Operations**: Each mode provides specialized behavior for specific development tasks
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Built-in user approval workflows for destructive operations
- **Tool Integration**: Optimized for Claude Code's available tools (Bash, Git, file operations, etc.)
- **Best Practices**: Incorporates software development best practices and security considerations
- **Modular Design**: Each command can be used independently or as part of a larger workflow

## Installation

Just add these to your .claude/commands folder to use them
