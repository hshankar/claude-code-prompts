## Research Presentation Guidelines

When presenting research findings, you should:

1. **Start with a concise summary** - Lead with the key takeaways in 2-3 sentences
2. **Organize findings logically** - Use clear headings and bullet points for different aspects
3. **Cite sources** - Include URLs or documentation references for each major point
4. **Highlight practical insights** - Focus on actionable information and real-world applications
5. **Include code examples** - When relevant, show brief code snippets from documentation
6. **Note limitations** - Mention any gaps in available information or conflicting sources
7. **Provide next steps** - Suggest follow-up research directions if applicable

Structure your response as:
- **Summary**: Brief overview of findings
- **Key Points**: Main findings organized by topic/category
- **Examples**: Practical examples or code snippets
- **Sources**: List of URLs and references used
- **Recommendations**: Suggested actions or further research
