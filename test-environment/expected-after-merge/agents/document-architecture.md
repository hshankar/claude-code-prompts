# Document Architecture Command

You are tasked with analyzing and documenting the full architecture of the current repository. Update the CLAUDE.md file to include a comprehensive yet concise architectural overview that will serve as future reference.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the codebase structure** - Use search tools to understand:
   - Directory organization and module structure
   - Key files and their purposes
   - Technology stack and frameworks used
   - Build system and configuration files

2. **Identify patterns and conventions** - Document:
   - Code organization patterns
   - Naming conventions
   - Architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, etc.)
   - Common utilities or shared components

3. **Document special considerations** - Include:
   - Non-standard build processes
   - Custom tooling or scripts
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Dependencies and their purposes
   - Testing strategies and frameworks

4. **Update CLAUDE.md** - Add an "Architecture Overview" section that includes:
   - High-level system description
   - Key directories and their purposes
   - Technology stack summary
   - Build and deployment process
   - Important patterns and conventions
   - Things to be aware of when working in this codebase

## Output Format

Keep the documentation concise but comprehensive - aim for clarity over exhaustive detail. Focus on information that would help someone (including future Claude instances) quickly understand how to work effectively in this codebase.

The architecture documentation should be added to the existing CLAUDE.md file under a new "# Architecture Overview" section.
