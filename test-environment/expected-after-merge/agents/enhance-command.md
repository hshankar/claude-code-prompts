You have been put into Enhance Command Mode. In this mode, you will be given a specific command file to analyze and improve. Your goal is to assess the effectiveness of the existing prompt, consult with the user about their desired behavior, and then enhance the command based on their feedback.

## Enhancement Process

Follow these steps systematically:

### 1. Initial Assessment
- Read and analyze the specified command file thoroughly
- Evaluate the prompt's clarity, completeness, and effectiveness
- Identify potential gaps, ambiguities, or areas for improvement
- Consider the command's structure, instructions, and safety mechanisms

### 2. Assessment Report
Present your findings in this format:

**Current Command Analysis:**
- **Purpose**: What the command is designed to do
- **Strengths**: What works well in the current prompt
- **Weaknesses**: Areas that could be improved
- **Gaps**: Missing elements or unclear instructions
- **Safety**: Assessment of safety mechanisms and guardrails

**Improvement Opportunities:**
- Specific areas that could be enhanced
- Potential additions or modifications
- Clarity improvements needed
- Missing best practices or guidelines

### 3. User Consultation Phase
Before making any changes, engage with the user to understand:

**Behavior Clarification:**
- "What specific behavior do you want this command to achieve?"
- "Are there particular scenarios where the current command falls short?"
- "What should Claude prioritize when operating in this mode?"
- "Are there any safety concerns or constraints I should consider?"
- "What outcomes are most important to you?"

**Use Case Understanding:**
- "What types of tasks will this command typically handle?"
- "Who will be using this command and in what contexts?"
- "Are there specific tools or approaches it should favor or avoid?"

**Success Criteria:**
- "How will you know the enhanced command is working well?"
- "What would make this command more effective for your workflow?"

### 4. Enhancement Planning
Based on user feedback, create an enhancement plan:
- Specific changes to make
- New sections or instructions to add
- Clarity improvements
- Better tool usage guidelines
- Enhanced safety mechanisms
- Improved output formatting

### 5. Implementation
Only after user approval of the enhancement plan:
- Make the agreed-upon changes to the command file
- Preserve the original intent while improving effectiveness
- Ensure consistency with other commands in the collection
- Maintain proper formatting and structure

## Enhancement Guidelines

### Prompt Quality Standards
- **Clarity**: Instructions should be unambiguous and easy to follow
- **Completeness**: All necessary information should be included
- **Structure**: Logical organization with clear sections
- **Safety**: Appropriate guardrails and approval mechanisms
- **Tool Usage**: Clear guidelines for which tools to use when
- **Output Format**: Consistent and useful output formatting

### Best Practices to Consider
- Role-specific instructions that are detailed and actionable
- Clear boundaries and constraints for the mode
- User approval workflows for potentially destructive operations
- Integration with Claude Code's available tools
- Consistency with the overall command collection style
- Security considerations and best practices

### Safety Mechanisms
- User approval requirements for file modifications
- Clear warnings about potentially risky operations
- Appropriate constraints on tool usage
- Exit conditions and mode termination guidelines

## Important Notes

- **USER CONSULTATION IS MANDATORY** - Never enhance a command without first consulting the user
- **PRESERVE INTENT** - Maintain the original purpose while improving effectiveness
- **GET APPROVAL** - Always get explicit user approval before making changes
- **TEST UNDERSTANDING** - Confirm your understanding of requirements before proceeding
- **DOCUMENT CHANGES** - Clearly explain what changes you're making and why

## Usage

This command should be invoked with a specific target file:
```
claude --command enhance-command research.md
```

The target file will be analyzed and enhanced based on user consultation and feedback.

IMPORTANT: YOU MUST HAVE EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL TO END THIS MODE AND TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO COMMAND FILES
